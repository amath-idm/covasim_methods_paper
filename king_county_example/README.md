# King County example

This folder contains the code for the King County (Seattle) example used in the manuscript. Note: these examples can't be run since the data is not publicly available, but the code is shared for completeness.

## Usage

Calibration results are generated by `run_baseline.py`, which should take about a minute to run. Scenario results are generated by `run_scenarios.py`, which will take about 10 minutes to run the first time, and then about 2 minutes to run subsequently (since results are cached), if you can parallelize the 8 processes. Figures 1 and 2 of the report are generated by running `figs1-2_calib_proj.py` (which depends on `run_baseline.py` having been run). Figure 3 is generated by running -- surprise -- `fig3_scenarios.py` (which depends on `run_scenarios.py` having been run).

Covasim version 2.0 is expected; it must be cloned from this branch:
